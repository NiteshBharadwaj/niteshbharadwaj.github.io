        <h1>Welcome</h1>
		<p>I am Nitesh, a recent graduate from the <a href="http://ee.iitd.ernet.in/" target="ng_iitd">Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Delhi</a>. I like to describe myself as a geek and love anything technology - be it smartphones or signal processing or artificial intelligence or power electronics. I have also this entrepreneurial  vibe which sparks up whenever I see or face a problem. </p>
		<p>Presently, I am working at Finmechanics, Mumbai. We are an (almost) all IITian crowd with a strong start-up like mentality. My typical day would involve writing a lot of code for the banks. Although I made it sound menial, it is quite interesting and involves a lot of focussed thinking to make the code simple, yet scalable. Since we cater to treasury departments, 
		there is a lot of mathematics involved, especially to price derivatives. While math itself wouldn't be an issue, as it is just additions and multiplications running in loops, 
		the technological challenges it brings with it in terms of demanding heavy processing power, good memory management etc. makes my professional life interesting. 
		</p>
		<h2>Research Interests:</h2>
        <p>I've listed some of the fields in which I wish to work in the future. It is huge (corresponds to my diverse academic interests) but isn't exhaustive. Specifically, it would be awesome if I were to be a part of something which would be a fusion of many different fields of engineering - the likes of Google Glass, Autonomous Vehicle Projects or the projects of MIT Media Labs </p>
        <ul>
		<li>Neural Networks / Machine Learning</li>
	  <li>Data analytics, Finance</li>
          <li>Autonomous Navigation</li>
          <li>Embedded Systems, IOTS</li>
	  <li>Machine Vision (Image Processing)</li>
	  <li>Information Theory (Analysis of gene data)</li>
	  <li>Robotics</li>
        </ul>
		<p>You can find more about me in the few tabs around. Feel free to explore the site and don't forget to post a feedback. Thanks! </p>
